1. Open a terminal window on your Mac by pressing Control-Space and typing terminal. Click to run the terminal 
as soon as it shows up in the Search results. 

2. Run: /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" 
(You should be able to just copy and paste the command--everything after the colon) 

3. Then run: 
brew cask install miniconda; 
brew install node; 
brew install nvm; 
brew cask install docker; 
brew install git
(Again, just copy and paste everything after the colon) 

4. Go to https://console.cortex.insights.ai/ and log in with the credentials you received via email from Cortex

5. Download Cortex Studio and install it as usual

6. Open a terminal window and type npm install -g cortex-cli 

7. Create a free Docker account at https://hub.docker.com/signup

8. On your keyboard, press Command-Space and then type Docker. Run Docker. 

9. Sign in to the Docker desktop application using your new account. 

You should have everything you need to run Cortex! 

P.S. Check out https://docs.cortex.insights.ai/docs/getting-started/cli/#configure-the-clifor more info for CLI configuration

P.S. Everything should be installed via Homebrew, but just in case you need the direct links to Node.js and Miniconda: 
https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.12.0/node-v8.12.0.pkg
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
You probably won't need them, but I'm providing the links just in case.
